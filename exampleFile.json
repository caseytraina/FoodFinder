The City has approximately 40,000 seniors whose income level falls below the federal poverty line. Our clients live with the daily threat of hunger. Being food-insecure can worsen chronic health problems that can in turn lead to the hospitalization. Food is a basic human need and without an adequate diet, people cannot fight off disease and infection. Low income seniors must often choose between purchasing food, or buying medicine to keep from getting sick. Groceries for Seniors distributes nutritious fresh food to approximately 1,000 senior citizens in San Francisco every week. Without our help, many of our elderly neighbors would go hungry.",
