# Welcome to Food Finder
**A Personal Development Casey Traina**

Food Finder is an app that seeks food equity. Currently exclusive to the Bay Area, Food Finder allows users to easily find the nearest soup kitchen, food pantry, or grocery store.

Despite the name, Food Finder is not, however, limited only to food. Come and find overnight shelters, educational support, drug rehabilition, employment assistance, and so much more!

### Map

Our home screen is intuitive and clear. Each location is categorized by a different symbol and color.
