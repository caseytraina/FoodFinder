# FoodFinder

An app I created on my May of 2022 as part of my high school final project. The app helps homeless people find food, shelter, and educational resources near them. I spoke with over 150 Bay Area homeless relief foundations to upload their credentials. The app leverages several Google Firebase technologies including authentication, realtime database, machine learning, and cloud storage.
